    Yellow: `Yellow is the color of happiness, optimism, creativity, and intellect. It is bright and cheerful, known to stimulate mental activity, sharpen memory, and energize the spirit. Yellow inspires communication and encourages playfulness, curiosity, and learning. It's a mentally activating hue associated with innovative thinking and mental clarity.

    However, yellow also carries intense emotional and psychological influence. When overused, it can induce anxiety, impatience, and nervousness. It may cause people to become overcritical or overwhelmed. Yellow is linked to fear, betrayal, cowardice, and impulsiveness, reflecting the color's potential to stimulate discomfort as much as joy.
    
    Yellow is often used as a highlight or attention-getter rather than a base tone. Its association with sunshine and brightness makes it uplifting and eye-catchingâ€”but its power can be overwhelming without balance.`,
    
    Blue: `Blue is the most universally appealing color on the spectrum due to its non-polarizing traits. It is calming, relaxing, and offers a sense of peace, serenity, and emotional stability. Blue symbolizes trust, responsibility, and loyalty, while also conveying authority and structure. 

    Those with a blue personality are often honest, committed, and supportive individuals who value friendship and strive for balance in their lives. They are dependable and emotionally aware, seeking order and harmony in both relationships and environments. Blue personalities are deeply affected by chaos or betrayal and may feel overwhelmed or nostalgic when stability is disrupted.

    On the downside, they can be conservative, predictable, and resistant to change. While generally warm and caring, their emphasis on control and structure can also make them come across as rigid or emotionally distant.

    Too much exposure to blue may suppress appetite and melatonin. Though rare in nature, blue is tied closely to elements like the sky and sea, both of which contribute to its widespread associations with depth, openness, and tranquility.
