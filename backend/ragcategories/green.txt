[DESCRIPTION]
Green is the color of nature, symbolizing growth, balance, and renewal. It embodies harmony and stability, often associated with health, prosperity, and generosity. Individuals with a green personality are diplomatic, peaceful, and caring, striving to bring harmony to their communities. They are practical and down-to-earth, with a strong sense of loyalty and a desire to belong. However, they may also exhibit negative traits such as envy, materialism, and possessiveness.
